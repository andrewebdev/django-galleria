h1. django-galleria

Galleria is a beautiful javascript gallery for your webiste, and django-galleria is a django application that helps you to add django galleria to your existing django project.

The main motivation for starting this app was because I use zc.buildout to install all sorts of requirements for my projects, and I couldn't be bothered to manually download the galleria app every time I wanted to use it in a project. Now I just include the django-galleria app in my required eggs, and everything get's done for me.

h2. Requirements

Django 1.3+ or, if you are using an older version of django, the django-staticfiles app (haven't tested the latter).

h2. Usage

After installing, you need to add @'galleria'@ to your @INSTALLED_APPS@ settings, as well as @'galleria.context_processors.galleria_urls'@ to your @TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS@.

This gives you the following Context Variables to work with:

* GALLERIA_URL - The root url where the galleria script and themes are located
* GALLERIA_SCRIPT - The url to galleria.js
* GALLERIA_THEME - The url to the default galleria theme

Each one of those variables can be changed in your settings.py file if you wish to do so.

h2. Example HTML

bc.. <script src="{{ GALLERIA_SCRIPT }}" type="text/javascript" />
<script type="text/javascript"> Galleria.loadTheme('{{ GALLERIA_THEME }}'); </script>

p. After that you can just follow the normal "galleria instructions here":http://galleria.aino.se/docs/1.2/getting_started/quick_start/
